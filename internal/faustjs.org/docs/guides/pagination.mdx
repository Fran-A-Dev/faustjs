This guide covers how to set up Pagination in your Faust.js site with Apollo and WPGraphQL.

## Setup

To get started, create a folder in the root of your Faust.js project called `plugins`.  In this `plugins` folder, create a file called `RelayStylePagination.js` and insert this content:

```
import { relayStylePagination } from "@apollo/client/utilities";

export class RelayStylePagination {
  apply(hooks) {
    const { addFilter } = hooks;

    addFilter("apolloClientInMemoryCacheOptions", "faust", (options) => {
      return {
        ...options,
        typePolicies: {
          ...options.typePolicies,
          RootQuery: {
            ...options.typePolicies.RootQuery,
            fields: {
              posts: relayStylePagination(),
            },
          },
          ContentType: {
            fields: {
              contentNodes: relayStylePagination(),
            },
          },
        },
      };
    });
  }
}
```
The Apollo client can implement [relay-style pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/cursor-based/) with the relay spec using merge and read functions, which means all the details of `connections`, `edges` and `pageInfo` can be abstracted away, into a single, reusable helper function. WPGraphQL follows the relay spec as well.
We are importing the `relayStylePagination` function from Apollo and the a `class component` is created which is the basic syntax of the Faust plugin.
