This guide covers how to set up Pagination in your Faust.js site with Apollo and WPGraphQL.

## Setup

To get started, create a folder in the root of your Faust.js project called `plugins`.  In this `plugins` folder, create a file called `RelayStylePagination.js` and insert this content:

```
import { relayStylePagination } from "@apollo/client/utilities";

export class RelayStylePagination {
  apply(hooks) {
    const { addFilter } = hooks;

    addFilter("apolloClientInMemoryCacheOptions", "faust", (options) => {
      return {
        ...options,
        typePolicies: {
          ...options.typePolicies,
          RootQuery: {
            ...options.typePolicies.RootQuery,
            fields: {
              posts: relayStylePagination(),
            },
          },
          ContentType: {
            fields: {
              contentNodes: relayStylePagination(),
            },
          },
        },
      };
    });
  }
}
```
The Apollo client can implement [relay-style pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/cursor-based/) with the relay spec using merge and read functions, which means all the details of `connections`, `edges` and `pageInfo` can be abstracted away, into a single, reusable helper function. WPGraphQL follows the relay spec as well.
We are importing the `relayStylePagination` function from Apollo and then a `class component` is created which is the basic syntax of the Faust plugin.

Next, we have an `apply` method with the `hooks` parameter which is an object that gives you a function called `addFilter`. The `addFilter` function allows us to modify the [Apollo Clientâ€™s `InMemoryCacheOptions`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/).

The `addFilter` hook is taken and calls the memory cache function options. The options are coming from the Apollo Client Cache configuration. These options allow for configuring the cache for  pagination. The faust namespace follows that.
